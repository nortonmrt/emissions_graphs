# Emission and temperature graphs
This file contains a set of graphs generated for my Bachelor's Thesis, which main topic was pollutant emissions and temperature distribution from a pyrolytic burner operated with biomass (wood pellets). For a better context, the entire thesis can be seen at https://drive.google.com/file/d/12oOQR24re0lY6JcA7wV2J2wS4F9wtM4w/view?usp=share_link

The pollutant emissions data was acquired using a Testo 350 analyzer, and the temperature data acquired from a type K thermocouple. The data was exported in Excel format, which could be handled using the routine here implemented. 3 different power conditions were tested for emissions, but in this file only one of them is shown, since the other 2 are very similar. The temperature profile of the 3 conditions is also shown.
